# Movie Maker 64

Movie Maker 64 is a basic tool intended for use in creating Super Mario 64 machinima based on [M64MM2](https://github.com/jpmac26/M64MM2). It provides the ability to perform actions such as freezing the camera and swapping animations on the fly in a running emulation of Super Mario 64.

Running the graphical user interface requires a computer with at least a supported version of Windows and .NET Framework 4.7.1 installed. The core library itself runs on .NET Standard 2.0 and there are plans to support other environments in the future.

Information on contributing and other details will be provided in the near future.
